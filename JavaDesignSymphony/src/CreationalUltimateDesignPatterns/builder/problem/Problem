To separate the construction of an object
    from it's representation

Real example
    PowerPoint/KeyNote
        Export or presentation in different formats
            PDF
            PowerPoint
            Movie and so on

            Presentation -> export()
                Problems
                    1. Violates the open closed principle. If tomorrow we want to support a new presentation format, we
                    have to come back and modify this method
                    2. tight coupling between the presentation class and these other classes like PDF, Movie and so on.
                    As we support more presentation format in - our coupling increases.
                    3. our presentation class should also have the knowledge of the structure of the classes:
                        PDF document have pages
                        Movies have frames

                        As we support more presentationFormats, this class is going to get bloated with so much
                        knowledge, so much knowledge  that really belong somewhere else.
                    4. Problem in this method is the repetition in our exporting logic. For each presentation format
                    we are iterating over our slides, getting the text on the slide and adding something to the target
                    object. If tomorrow we decide  to add a corporate message here, let's say the corporate message is
                    going to be  at the front  of our target presentation, then we will have to make multiple changes in
                    this code.
                        pdf.addPage("Copyright");

                        movie.addFrame("Copyright");
