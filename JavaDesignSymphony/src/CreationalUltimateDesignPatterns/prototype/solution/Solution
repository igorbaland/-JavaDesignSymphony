Current structure
    we have the component interface
        which is implemented by the
            Circle
                The contextMenu,
                    which is dependent on the circle. ----> //dependent


Solve this problem
    to move the logic or the responsibility for duplicating a circle from contextMenu to circle
        Because this is where we have all the information about circle.
            We know about its radius, background, color, header and so on.

            This is the right place assign responsibility

            Circle
                we are going to define clone() method,
                    which knows how to clone a circle. But cloning is not limited to circles. In fact, all kinds of
                    components should be cloneable.

                    Component
                    we are gonna add clone() to the component interface as well.

                        With this, we can decouple the ContextMenu from circle and have it talked to the component
                        interface.

                        This is what we call
                            prototype pattern
