The abstract factory pattern
    provide an interface
        for creating families of related objects

Let's imagine we want to build a GUI framework
    Widgets
        button
        textBox
        Drop-down list

    Themes
        material design, which is what we see in android or other google products
        ant


            Here we have families of related objects, we have one family on
                widgets work (material design) and another
                ant

                This is where we use the abstract factory pattern.

Problems with this implementation
    1. Violates the open closed principle. If tomorrow we decide to support a new kind of theme, we have to come back
        to our contactForm and modify render() method
    2. We have to be careful about the type of Classes we are using in ContactForm.render()

        This is where we use the
            abstract factory pattern
                provides an interface for creating families of related objects
