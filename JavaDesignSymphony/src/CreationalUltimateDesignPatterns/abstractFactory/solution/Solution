The first thing we need to understand
    FACTORY METHOD is a method

    ABSTRACT FACTORY is an abstraction (interface), it's an interface to creating

    In our project we are gonna introduce
        WidgetFactory
            createButton()
            createTextBox()

            Each method is a factory method, where are the widgetFactory itself is an abstraction, an interface

            We can create a concrete implementations
                materialFactory
                    only knows how to create material design/widget
                antFactory


This what we call the
    abstract design pattern
        We have an abstractFactory
            with methods for creating
                different kind of products

                All these products are in the same family
