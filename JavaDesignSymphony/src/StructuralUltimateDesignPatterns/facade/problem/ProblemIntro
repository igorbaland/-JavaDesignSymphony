We use this pattern to provide a simple interface
    to a complex system.

Real Example
    Let's imagine we are going to build mobile app.
        And as part of this app,
            we want to send and push notifications to our users.
We are going to add a bunch of classes for
    //connect() -> Connection
        //authenticate(appID, key) -> AuthToken
        //send(authToken, message, targetDevice)
        //conn.disconnect()
