To treats these types the same way, we need to extract what is common between these two typesÂ´and put it inside
a base class or an interface

common
Shape and group has
    function
        render

We need to introduce

    Shape
                    interface Component
     --->               render()

    Group
        With this structure instead of maintaining a list of object instances
            we can store a list of components
                List<Component>

                add(cmp: Component)

We use this pattern, whenever we want represent hierarchy and we want to treat objects in this the same way
