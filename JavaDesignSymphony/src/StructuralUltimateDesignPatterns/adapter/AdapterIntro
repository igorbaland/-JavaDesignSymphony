We use this pattern to convert
    the interface of a class/object to a different form

We want to build one of those mobile apps for our playing pretty filters to our photos
    we can capture or load the photo
        and then apply various filters to it


_____
ImageView   ---dependent--->    Interface Filter
apply(Filter)                   apply(Image)

//third party libraries         //concrete implementation
Caramel                         VividFilter

we can't not use the Caramel Class
    because concrete class/3rd party libraries
        doesn't implements this interface
            this is the class that we imported from a 3rd party library
                We cannot change the source code
                We cannot have it implement the filter interface

Solve
    create CaramelFilter        //adapter
       composition
        Caramel             //adoptee
