We use this pattern to
    add additional behavior to an object.

Real example
    Let's imagine we just got hired in a startup company
        that is going to sell
            cloud hosting services.
    Our job is to implement a class for storing data in the cloud.
        see in cloudStream class


Decorator pattern
    we can add additional behavior to an object. In our main method we can create a regular cloud stream object.
    and then
        we can decorate it with additional behavior. For example
            compression
            encryption
            logging...

            We can decorate this object with different behaviors.
