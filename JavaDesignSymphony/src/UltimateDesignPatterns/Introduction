Design patterns
  elegant solutions to repeating problems
    For example we want to repeat
      undo function in our application. That's repeating problem in software design

Gang of four design pattern include 23 design patterns in three categories:
  > Creational
    are all about different ways to create object structural

  > Structural
    relationship between these objects

  > Behavioural
    interaction or communication between these objects

By the way these design patterns don't represent  all the patterns in the world. There are many unofficial and
undocumented patterns out there that we might find useful in  certain situations. But  these 23 patterns are the classic
ones that every software engineer must  understand.
