Difference between memento and command pattern when it comes to undo operations?
  Memento pattern
    we store the changes in the state of the object, so we store multiple snapshots over time. Sometimes storing  these
    snapshots can be expensive. For example, let's say we are building a video editor. A video is a large file, so
    storing multiple snapshots of a video is going to be very expensive, it's going to waste a lot of memory. In those
    situations, it is better to use
      Command pattern
        because every command knows how to undo itself. So we don't have to store multiple snapshots of an object. For
        example, resize operation. If the user resize the video, all we have to store is the original dimension of the
        video, not the entire snapshot of the video object, we only store the previous dimension.
